## Data Science Communication Skills

This section was written by Matt Elliott.


### Introduction

Hi! My name is Matt Elliott and I decided to start this presentation off by 
introducing myself and what I hope to become moving forward! I am currently 
a Senior aiming to graduate in Fall 2024 with a Bachelor’s of Arts in 
Individualized Data Science under the CLAS’ IISP program. My primary advisor
is our professor Jun Yan! Moving forward, I hope to learn valuable skill sets 
and ideas from both this course and the Data Science field. Even using Quarto
instead of typical Google Slides is a step for me in creating new skills! The 
topic I chose to discuss today in class is “Data Science Communication Skills”
. I find this to be one of the most crucial topics to discuss about 
Data Science; since Data Scientists are often the glue that keeps 
projects, companies, and ideas together. 


### Describing Data Science and its Rise

- According to IBM, Data Science “combines math and statistics, specialized 
programming, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine 
learning with specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights
hidden in an organization’s data.   

- These insights are then used to “guide decision making” and create 
“strategic planning”

- According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Data Science is  
“projected to grow 35 percent from 2022 to 2032, much faster than the average 
for all occupations”

- The median annual pay for Data Scientists in May 2022 was around $103,500, 
showing its high demand in a monetary light

### Why does Communication Matter?


- Communication matters in any professional setting in our lives, and 
especially in a field that can be extremely confusing and perplexing to 
those who are viewing it from an outside perspective. 

- The Data Incubator states that “You may work alongside data analysts or 
other scientists as part of a team, especially when handling large datasets 
or working on big projects. Beyond this, you may also frequently work with 
other teams of professionals who don’t work with data. Thus, it’s essential 
to be an excellent communicator to work with others effectively”. This is an 
important idea as being able to be a cooperative person will create 
partnerships that flow in the correct manner.

- Data Scientists often present insights to other partners in order to 
facilitate goals and achievements in a professional setting. 

- Karen Church for Medium writes that “Communication enables data scientists to
gather all the necessary information, clarify needs and expectations of 
stakeholders, and align their work with broader business goals.”

### Inherent Communication Skills


- Using the right communication methods
- Friendliness
- Confidence
- Volume and tone
- Empathy
- Respect
- Cues

### Identify your audience
- The Data Incubator states that “Transferring knowledge across departments is 
crucial, so it’s vital to share insights and analyses in simple, clear terms 
that don’t overwhelm individuals with jargon or technical details.”

- Identifying your audience and speaking their language is an important step,
as it can vary to low familiarity to full comprehension of the topic

- In a 2018 HBR.org article, Hugo Bowne-Anderson interviewed 35 data scientists
on his podcast and found that their main issues were: 
“lack of management/financial support,” “lack of clear questions to answer,” 
“results not used by decision makers,” and “explaining data science to others.”
from Harvard Business Review 

- Knowing your audience in this situation can cover your back on how 
Data Scientists are treated in the field, communicating creates cooperation 
that can lead to the avoidance of these issues found.

### Data Applictions

- Data scientists have their hands full as many different fields and 
professions can use data analytics and information to 
facilitate their operations

- These fields include:
   + Healthcare
   + Media/Entertainment
   + Retail
   + Telecommunication
   + Automotive 
   + Digital Marketing
   + Cyber security 
- Data science communication skills vary in these fields, as some may prefer
verbal information or visual information.

### Storytelling

- Storytelling in the context of Data Science gives the audience a shared goal 
within understanding the topics and information given. 
- The goals of promoting improved customer service, innovation, or operation 
optimization need to be conveyed in a manner that is direct and professional.
- According to Sonali Verghese for Medium, here are the possibilities of 
telling a story within the Data Science field:
    + Explain how you arrived at a particular conclusion
    + Justify rationally why you approached a problem in a specific manner
    + Convey interesting insights in a way that gets people to think or act 
    differently
    + Persuade your audience that your results are conclusive and can be turned
    into something actionable
    + Express why your findings are valuable and how they fit into the overall
    picture
- This is an inspiring quotation that I found while researching this 
presentation. Valentin Mucke for Medium: “Data science is about humans. 
Data scientists must remember that, and not just when presenting to people
with a non-technical background. It’s important to find common ground with
everyone you work with to build trust and move forward effectively.

### Data Visualization

- The idea of expressing data through visualization has been a 
vital step for Data Scientists in the field
- Examples of Data Visualization for Data Scientists are:
    + Many of these forms of visualization can be combined with other
learned skill sets that will be mentioned in the next topic

### Usable Skill Sets for Data Communication

- Coding languages: Python, Structured Query Language, R, Visual Basic 
for Applications, Julia

- Statistical programming:  the process of using computer programming 
languages to analyze and manipulate data for statistical purposes

- Statistics and probability: help predict the likelihood of future events 
and understand patterns in data

- Machine learning/Artificial intelligence: automates the data analysis process 
and makes predictions in real-time without human involvement, leading to 
further building and training of a data model to make real-time predictions

- Statistical visualization: the graphical representation of information and
data that uses visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, and tools to 
provide an accessible ways to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns
in data

- Data management: process of collecting, storing, organizing and maintaining
data to ensure that it is accurate and accessible to those who need it reliably
throughout the data science project lifecycle

### Gather questions and Feedback

- According to the Data Incubator, a step to take before finalizing the project
or an end of a report is to “consider soliciting direct feedback from your 
audience. It doesn’t matter if you have to prompt them to ask you questions 
or if they’re impatient to put your knowledge to the test—this form of 
interaction can help you improve your communication skills and establish a 
successful career as a data scientist.” 

- Being able to interact with your audience gives them a better
understanding of the topic at hand, and can help avoid ambiguity that 
would occur if communication was not present
